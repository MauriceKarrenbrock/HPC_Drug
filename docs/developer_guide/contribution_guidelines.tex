\section{Contribution Guidelines}
		
			If you would like to contribute to the project (it is an open-source software licensed with the agpl v3 license) can do it though the GitHub repository https://github.com/MauriceKarrenbrock/HPC\_Drug\\
			If you found a bug, or have an idea for an improvement simply open an issue.\\
			If you would like to contribute with some code first open an issue in order to talk about your idea and hear the opinion of the other users and developers, it would be a bit of a pity if you did a lot of work on something no one agrees on. If it is a little thing link your pull request to the issue from the beginning in order to check if everything is ok, or if there might be needed some changes to accept it. If yours is a bigger idea please write WIP in the end of the issue title so everyone knows it is a work in progress with no available pull request yet or that could need more than one pull request , in this case the issue would be used as a place to discuss and talk about the implementation of the new idea, to solve problems, and to answer any possible question.
			
			If you are writing a piece of code please remember to make it as modular, flexible, maintainable, readable and pythonic as possible, speed in fact is not a goal of this program, but expandability and flexibility are. And please try to write the needed unit-tests (and if possible integration and end to end tests), try to comment (and write) the code in a way that future developers will be able to understand it, and, if it makes sense for the kind of contribution you made, update the documentation with your new creation.
			
			For the rest have fun and may the Force of Drug Discovery be with you!
