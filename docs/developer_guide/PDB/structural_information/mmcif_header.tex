\subsection{HPC\_Drug/PDB/structural\_information/mmcif\_header.py}

    This file contains the files necessary to parse the header of a mmCIF file

    \subsubsection{Function get\_ligand\_binding\_residues(mmcif2dict, metals = important\_lists.metals)}

        This function is called from get\_metalbinding\_disulf\_ligands

        Searces the given mmcif file for the metal binding residues parsing the header returns a dictionary that has as key the residue number and as vaue a tuple with (resname, binding atom, metal) for metal binding residues

        mmcif2dict :: a dictionary of the type you obtain with HPC\_Drug.PDB.biopython.mmcif2dict function

        metals :: a list (or tuple etc) that contains all the resnames (in capital letters) of metals necessary to look for, default HPC\_Drug.important\_lists.metals (Actually the easiest way to personalize metals is to append your custom values to this list)

        return {resnum : (resname, binding atom, metal), ...}

    \subsubsection{Function get\_disulf\_bonds(mmcif2dict)}
    
        This function is called from get\_metalbinding\_disulf\_ligands

        Searces the given mmcif file for disulf bonds parsing the header returns a dictionary that has as key the residue number and as vaue a tuple with ('CYS', 'SG', 'disulf') for any disulf cysteine.\\
        And a a list composed of tuples containing the resnumbers of the 2 CYS that bound through disulfide bond

        mmcif2dict :: a dictionary of the type you obtain with HPC\_Drug.PDB.biopython.mmcif2dict function

        return {resnum : ('CYS', 'SG', 'disulf'), ...}   [(resnum, resnum), (...), ...]

    \subsubsection{Function get\_organic\_ligands(mmcif2dict, protein\_chain = None, trash = important\_lists.trash, metals = important\_lists.metals)}
    
        This function is called from get\_metalbinding\_disulf\_ligands

        Searces the given mmcif file for organic ligands parsing the header returns a list of resnames. If protein chain is None (default) will list all ligands from any chain, if protein chain is set does only consider the ones of the given chain (es A)

        mmcif2dict :: a dictionary of the type you obtain with HPC\_Drug.PDB.biopython.mmcif2dict function

        protein\_chain :: string, default None, the chain id of the chain you want to analize in capital letters (es A)

        trash :: a list (or tuple etc) that contains all the resnames (in capital letters) of trash ligands to avoid listing,
        default HPC\_Drug.important\_lists.trash (Actually the easiest way to personalize trash is to append your custom values to this list)

        metals :: a list (or tuple etc) that contains all the resnames (in capital letters) of metals necessary to look for,
        default HPC\_Drug.important\_lists.metals (Actually the easiest way to personalize metals is to append your custom values to this list)

        return [resname, resname, ...]

    \subsubsection{Function get\_ligand\_resnum(structure, ligand\_resnames = None, protein\_chain = 'A', protein\_model = 0)}
    
        This function is called from get\_metalbinding\_disulf\_ligands

        Given a Biopython structure and a list of Ligand\_resnames will return 
        a list containing the ligand resnames and resnumbers
        in order to distinguish ligands with the same resname: [[resname, resnumber], [.., ...], ...]
        
        ligand\_resnames :: list, it is a list containing the organic ligand resnames (capital letters) to look for
        if it is == None or empty will return None

        protein\_chain :: string, default A, the chain id of the chain you want to analize in capital letters (es A), if == None no chain selection will be done
        
        protein\_model :: integer, default 0, the model to check, if == None no chain and no model selection will be done

        return [[resname, resnumber], [.., ...], ...]

    \subsubsection{Function get\_metalbinding\_disulf\_ligands(Protein, trash = important\_lists.trash, metals = important\_lists.metals)}
    
        This is a template that uses the other funcions on this file to return a dictionary with key = resnum and value = (resname, binding atom, metal) or ('CYS', 'SG', 'disulf') depending if the residue number {resnum} binds a metallic ion or is part of a disulf bond and updates Protein.substitutions\_dict with it

        and a list of tuples that contain the couples of CYS that are part of a disulf bond and updates Protein.sulf\_bonds with it

        and a list of tuples with the residue name and residue number of the organic ligands (if there are none None will be returned)

        Protein :: a HPC\_Drug.structures.protein.Protein instance

        trash :: a list (or tuple etc) that contains all the resnames (in capital letters) of trash ligands to avoid listing, default HPC\_Drug.important\_lists.trash (Actually the easiest way to personalize trash is to append your custom values to this list)

        metals :: a list (or tuple etc) that contains all the resnames (in capital letters) of metals necessary to look for, default HPC\_Drug.important\_lists.metals (Actually the easiest way to personalize metals is to append your custom values to this list)

        return Protein, [[lig\_resname, lig\_resnum], ...]
