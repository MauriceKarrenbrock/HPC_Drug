    \subsubsection{Function write\_file(lines, file\_name = "file.txt")}
        
        This function writes a new file or overrides an existing one (no safety check is done!).
        lines can be a single string or an iterable (list, tuple etc\dots) and contains the lines that will be written on the file.
        file\_name must be a string and is the name of the file that will be created.
            \\
        Absolutely no formatting is done on the strings so they must be already formatted properly (like with newline $\\n$).

    \subsubsection{Function append\_file(lines, file\_name = "file.txt")}

        This function appends some lines to an existing file.
        lines can be a single string or an iterable (list, tuple etc\dots) and contains the lines that will be written on the file.
        file\_name must be a string and is the name of the file that will be edited.
            \\
        Absolutely no formatting is done on the strings so they must be already formatted properly (like with newline $\\n$).
