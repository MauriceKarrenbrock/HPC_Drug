# HPC_Drug
A middleware python tool for computational drug discovery on HPC architectures

This is a work in progress, there is still plenty of refactoring and testing to be donebut the main functionality (main.py and automizable_main.py) should work as expected with "well behaving proteines"

In requirements.txt you will find the python requirements but for openmm ( conda install -c omnia-dev openmm ) biopython (github)  and pdbfixer (github)  the development version is required due to some important bug fixes

There are other not python dependencies: primadorac  Orac (both downloadable on  http://www.chim.unifi.it/orac ) and gromacs ( http://www.gromacs.org )

The documentation is a work in progress and will be included as soon as possible
